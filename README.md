Gnome TextBox
=============

### Overview

TextBox is a graphical application that provides all the functionality of a
modern pseudo-terminal without the burden of emulating a terminal. TextBox also
provides new functionality such as, event driven key binding, HTML like markup,
embedded images, separate read and write positions, dynamic line oriented
coordinates, and line editing semantics. Note you will need
[libtb](https://codrod.github.io/libtb/index.html) to use a TextBox in your application.
This implementation of TextBox uses the gtkmm bindings for the GIMP Toolkit (GTK).
