Text\+Box is a graphical application that provides all the functionality of a modern pseudo-\/terminal without the burden of emulating a terminal. Text\+Box also provides new functionality such as, event driven key binding, H\+T\+ML like markup, embedded images, separate read and write positions, dynamic line oriented coordinates, and line editing semantics. Note you will need \href{https://codrod.github.io/libtb/index.html}{\tt libtb} to use a Text\+Box in your application. This implementation of Text\+Box uses the gtkmm bindings for the G\+I\+MP Toolkit (G\+TK).
